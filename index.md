<!-- Millions of people participate in online peer-to-peer support sessions, yet there has been little prior research on systematic psychology-based evaluations of fine-grained peer-counselor behavior in relation to client satisfaction. This paper seeks to bridge this gap by mapping peer-counselor chat-messages to motivational
interviewing (MI) techniques. We annotate 14,797 utterances from 734 chat conversations using 17 MI techniques and introduce four new interviewing codes such as “chit-chat” and “inappropriate” to account for the unique conversational patterns observed on online platforms. We automate the process of labeling
peer-counselor responses to MI techniques by fine-tuning large domain-specific language models and then use these automated measures to investigate the behavior of the peer counselors via correlational studies. Specifically, we study the impact of MI techniques on the conversation ratings to investigate the techniques
that predict clients’ satisfaction with their counseling sessions. When counselors use techniques such as reflection and affirmation, clients are more satisfied. Examining volunteer counselors’ change in usage of techniques suggest that counselors learn to use more introduction and open questions as they gain experience.
This work provides a deeper understanding of the use of motivational interviewing techniques on peer-to-peer counselor platforms and sheds light on how to build better training programs for volunteer counselors on online platforms.\ -->

1. Bitcoin Data Analytics: Scalable techniques for transaction clustering and embedding generation\
Authors: **Raj Sanjay Shah**, Ashutosh Bhatia, Atith Gandhi and Shray Mathur\

<!-- Abstract: Bitcoin provides pseudo-anonymity to its users, leading to many transactions related to illicit activities. The advent of mixing services like OnionBC, Bitcoin Fog, and Blockchain.info has allowed users to increase their anonymity further. This paper tackles the pseudo-anonymity of the Bitcoin blockchain by developing a scalable spark based framework to find patterns in the transaction data. The efficacy of the framework is demonstrated by performing exploratory analysis. Furthermore, the paper shows the capabilities of bitcoin-based graph representations and addresses the issue of user profiling based on unsupervised learning approaches for analysing Bitcoin transactions and users. The authors convert the transaction graph of the Bitcoin data to contain only Wallet-IDs and generate graph embeddings using Variational Graph Autoencoder. Additionally, the authors use explainable-AI techniques and Kohonen self organizing maps to visualize and understand the results obtained from the unsupervised learning methods.\ -->

1. CTI-Twitter: Gathering Cyber Threat Intelligence from Twitter using Integrated Supervised and Unsupervised Learning\
Authors: Linn-Mari Kristiansen, Vinti Agarwal, Katrin Franke and **Raj Sanjay Shah**\
Accepted in [The 4th International Workshop on Big Data Analytic for Cyber Crime Investigation and Prevention, IEEE International Conference on Big Data 2020](https://folk.ntnu.no/andriis/bdaccip2020/)\
<!-- Abstract: Cyber threat intelligence (CTI) can be gathered from multiple sources, and Twitter is one such open source platform where a large volume and variety of threat data is shared every day. The automated and timely mining of relevant threat knowledge from this data can be crucial for enrichment of existing threat intelligence platforms to proactively defend against cyber attacks. We propose CTI-Twitter: a novel framework combining supervised and unsupervised learning models to collect, process, analyze and generate threat specific knowledge from tweets coming from multiple users. CTI-Twitter has multi-fold contributions: i) first collecting tweets through Twitter API, ii) extracting relevant threat tweets from irrelevant ones, and classifying relevant ones into multiple classes of threats iii) then grouping tweets belonging to each class using topic modeling iv) finally performing data enrichment and verification process. We evaluate our proposed model on real-time tweets collected for about four months (in year 2020) using Twitter API. The encouraging results obtained indicate the effectiveness of CTI-Twitter in terms of timeliness and discovery of trending attacks patterns, and vulnerabilities. -->

Abstract: Bitcoin is the most successful cryptocurrency since its inception in 2009. There are 18.1 million BTCs in circulation as of December 2019, which roughly translates to 149 Billion USD. With Bitcoin’s substantial market capitalization and unique features like pseudo-anonymity and immutability, it draws much attention from the researchers across the world. Despite this enormous spotlight towards Bitcoin, it remains under-researched because of the large size of the Bitcoin Data, (Roughly 250 GB) and the inability to process this data in small time. To explore avenues for further research, this article presents a survey of the recent advancements done regarding the big data analytics of the Bitcoin Cryptocurrency. Furthermore, we propose an analysis framework based on the Apache Hadoop ecosystem.\ -->
