I'm a final year undergraduate student at Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani, India. My interest lies in building machine learning systems for cyberthreat intelligence and digital forensics. I have been actively working on Bitcoin Blockchain Data Analtics with Professor [Ashutosh Bhatia](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/pilani/ashutoshbhatia/profile) and on social network mining with Professor [Vinti Agarwal](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/pilani/vintiagarwal/Research).

Abstract: Bitcoin is the most successful cryptocurrency since its inception in 2009. There are 18.1 million BTCs in circulation as of December 2019, which roughly translates to 149 Billion USD. With Bitcoinâ€™s substantial market capitalization and unique features like pseudo-anonymity and immutability, it draws much attention from the researchers across the world. Despite this enormous spotlight towards Bitcoin, it remains under-researched because of the large size of the Bitcoin Data, (Roughly 250 GB) and the inability to process this data in small time. To explore avenues for further research, this article presents a survey of the recent advancements done regarding the big data analytics of the Bitcoin Cryptocurrency. Furthermore, we propose an analysis framework based on the Apache Hadoop ecosystem.\

Abstract: Cyber threat intelligence (CTI) can be gathered from multiple sources, and Twitter is one such open source platform where a large volume and variety of threat data is shared every day. The automated and timely mining of relevant threat knowledge from this data can be crucial for enrichment of existing threat intelligence platforms to proactively defend against cyber attacks. We propose CTI-Twitter: a novel framework combining supervised and unsupervised learning models to collect, process, analyze and generate threat specific knowledge from tweets coming from multiple users. CTI-Twitter has multi-fold contributions: i) first collecting tweets through Twitter API, ii) extracting relevant threat tweets from irrelevant ones, and classifying relevant ones into multiple classes of threats iii) then grouping tweets belonging to each class using topic modeling iv) finally performing data enrichment and verification process. We evaluate our proposed model on real-time tweets collected for about four months (in year 2020) using Twitter API. The encouraging results obtained indicate the effectiveness of CTI-Twitter in terms of timeliness and discovery of trending attacks patterns, and vulnerabilities.

3. Bitcoin Data Analytics: Scalable techniques fortransaction clustering and embedding generation\

Abstract: Bitcoin provides pseudo-anonymity to its users, leading to many transactions related to illicit activities. The advent of mixing services like OnionBC, Bitcoin Fog and Blockchain.info has allowed users to increase their anonymity further. We tackle the pseudo-anonymity of the Bitcoin blockchain by developing a scalable spark based framework. We demonstrate the efficacy of our framework by performing exploratory analysis. Furthermore, we show the capabilities of bitcoin-based graph representations and address the issue of user profiling based on unsupervised learning approaches for analysing Bitcoin transactions and users. We create a transaction graph of the Bitcoin data and generate a graph embedding using Variational Graph Autoencoder. Additionally, we use explainable-AI techniques and Kohonen self organizing maps to visualize and understand the results obtained from the unsupervised learning methods.
